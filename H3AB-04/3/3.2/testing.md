Test Strategy
=============

The program is a 2D shooter program built in Unity. It's main purpose is to teach myself about Unity and Object Oriented Programming.

### Features to test
Game screen transition
Player score
Player death
Enemy spawning
Score display after death
High score table on site

### Test approach
The testing done will be mostly exploratory testing, playing the game many times and noting any issues that arise.
Unit testing will also be done on the individual game screens to test the transition.

### Bug tracking
Bugs that are found will be added to a Trello board for easy tracking by myself.

### Task distribution
All testing will be carried out by myself.

### Documents
When bugs are found, these will be documented with steps to reproduce inside the Trello board ticket.
