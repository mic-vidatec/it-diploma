The testing done will be mostly exploratory testing, playing the game many times and noting any issues that arise.

### Bug tracking
Bugs that are found will be added to a Trello board for easy tracking by myself.

### Task distribution
All testing will be carried out by myself.

### Documents
When bugs are found, these will be documented with steps to reproduce inside the Trello board ticket.
