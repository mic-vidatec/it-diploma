Test Strategy
=============

The program is a command line interface to check the validity of a credit card number.

### Features to test
The program must correctly identify credit card numbers and what type of card they are.

### Test approach
The testing done will be using a series of known credit card numbers, and checking the program's response.

### Bug tracking
Bugs that are found will be added to a Trello board for easy tracking by myself.

### Task distribution
All testing will be carried out by myself.

### Documents
When bugs are found, these will be documented with steps to reproduce inside the Trello board ticket.
